                <h2>What is Dodgeball?</h2>
                <p>
                    Dodgeball is a sport originally created in Africa more than
                    200 years ago. While many have experienced basic variations
                    in primary or secondary school, they are frequently unaware
                    it is actually a full-fledged sport with an official set of
                    rules run by a worldwide organization called the World
                    Dodgeball Federation. In its official form, it has two
                    primary variations: foam dodgeball and cloth dodgeball.
                    Although slight rule variations exist between the two, both
                    versions share the same core principles. Two teams face off
                    on a court approximately the size of a volleyball court. The
                    goal is to knock the opposing team out by throwing balls
                    that hit their players or catching the opponents' thrown
                    balls. The first team to knock the other out wins!
                </p>

                <h2>Who are the Delftsche Dodgers?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Delftsche Dodgers traces its roots back to Fall 2019
                    when current President Frank Broy started a group of
                    dodgeball enthusiasts who played casual matches amongst
                    themselves. This grew in popularity and with help from the
                    sports center at TU Delft called "X", an official ticket
                    hour was created in Fall 2021 where every week, students
                    could sign up to play dodgeball with Frank as the host.
                    Eventually, a group of regular attendees decided they wanted
                    to take it even further and in Spring 2023, the Delftsche
                    Dodgers was officially founded with the goals of seriously
                    training skills and techniques, participating in the Dutch
                    national league, and helping to popularize the sport and
                    allow more people to partake and enjoy it as much as they
                    do.
